# Java-Converter-App

## Overview

This Java project implements a GUI-based converter application that converts miles to kilometers and Fahrenheit to Celsius. The application leverages Swing for the user interface, providing an interactive experience for users to input values and receive converted results. This project is part of my Intermediate Programming (CMIS 242) coursework at the University of Maryland Global Campus.

## Project Purpose
The main objectives of this project are:
- To create a user-friendly GUI application for converting distances and temperatures.
- To demonstrate the use of inheritance in Java by implementing a base converter class and extending it for specific conversions.
- To provide a practical example of event-driven programming using ActionListeners in Java Swing.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
Throughout this project, I have gained and demonstrated skills in the following areas:
- **Java Inheritance**: Implemented a base class and extended it for specific functionalities.
- **GUI Development**: Utilized Java Swing to create an interactive graphical user interface.
- **Event Handling**: Managed user interactions using ActionListeners.
- **Exception Handling**: Incorporated error handling to manage invalid user inputs.

## Project Impact
This project has helped me:
- Understand the principles of object-oriented programming, specifically inheritance and method overriding.
- Gain practical experience in building GUI applications using Java Swing.
- Develop skills in handling user inputs and providing appropriate feedback through dialogs.
- Improve my ability to manage and handle exceptions in a user-friendly manner.

## Files Included
- `CMIS242ASG3LoganToms.java`: The main Java file containing all the classes and logic for the converter application.

## Usage Instructions
1. **Compile the Java file**: Ensure you have JDK installed. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing `CMIS242ASG3LoganToms.java`. Run the following command:
   ```sh
   javac CMIS242ASG3LoganToms.java
   ```
2. **Run the application**: After successful compilation, run the application with:
   ```sh
   java CMIS242ASG3LoganToms
   ```
3. **Use the GUI**: The application window will open with buttons to convert distances and temperatures. Follow the prompts in the dialog boxes to enter values and view the converted results.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: The programming language used for developing the application.
- **Java Swing**: Used for creating the graphical user interface.
- **Java AWT**: Utilized for event handling and window management.
